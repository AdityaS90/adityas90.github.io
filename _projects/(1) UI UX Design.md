## What is Insights club?

“INSIGHTS” is a journalistic community club. Our goal is to create and distribute reports about the interactions of events, facts, and ideas that are “the news of the day”. The speciality of the Insights club will be to provide a bi-weekly newsletter that sums up all the ongoing, upcoming, and completed events, seminars, fests, etc.

Insights Club's objective is to provide a uniform flow of information directly and through the students of our university regarding all the events and current affairs of the university through online mode (web/socials) and on-field journalism. We intend to hold certain intra-campus events where students from any branch and campus are welcome to participate. The club will also focus on improving abilities that will stimulate the creation of innovative media messages.

## My Exprience
My experience with Insights has been a wonderful journey so far. The Technical Team has been very supportive and helpful in the whole designing and development process. All the ideas I pitched were listened to and delibrated. I am also happy to inform that my inputs were later implemented in the website aswell. I hope to continue working with the Club and giving my best for the future of the team.
